Task-1:
Titanic Classification:
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset and is often used for educational purposes. You can easily find it on various online platforms. One common source is the Kaggle website.
Once you're logged in, search for the "Titanic" dataset in the search bar.
Click on the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset. You'll find the dataset along with its description and download options.
Click on the "Download" button to download the dataset as a CSV file.
Creating a system to predict whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic based on factors like socio-economic status, age, gender, and more involves building a machine learning classification model. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can take:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Obtain the Titanic dataset, which includes features such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, etc., along with the target variable (survival).
Perform data preprocessing, which may involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender), and scaling/normalizing numerical features.

Feature Selection/Engineering:
Analyze the dataset to determine which features are likely to be most influential in predicting survival. This might involve exploratory data analysis and domain knowledge.
Create new features if relevant, such as family size by combining the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children on board.

Model Selection and Training:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or gradient boosting.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.
Train the chosen model on the training data and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix on the testing set.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and avoid overfitting.

Interpretation and Analysis:
Analyze the model to understand which factors (features) contribute most to survival predictions. This can help you identify the most important factors that lead to success (survival) in the Titanic scenario.

Deployment and Prediction:
Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to make predictions on new data.
Given a new set of feature values (socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.), the model can predict whether a person is likely to survive the Titanic sinking.
